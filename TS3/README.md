# Teacher Supervises Students How to Learn from Partially Labeled Images for Facial Landmark Detection
By Xuanyi Dong, Yi Yang

This paper presents a semi-supervised facial landmark detection algorithm.
In short, we propose to learn a teacher network that takes a pseudo labeled face as input and outputs the quality of its pseudo label. As a result, pseudo labeled samples which are qualified by the teacher will be used to train the student detector. We achieve higher accuracy than typical semi-supervised facial landmark methods.
