# Landmark Detection

This project contains several landmark detection algorithms, implemented in [PyTorch](pytorch.org).


## Style Aggregated Network for Facial Landmark Detection

The training and testing codes for [SAN (CVPR 2018)](https://xuanyidong.com/publication/cvpr-2018-san/) are located in the [SAN directory](https://github.com/D-X-Y/landmark-detection/tree/master/SAN).


## Supervision-by-Registration: An Unsupervised Approach to Improve the Precision of Facial Landmark Detectors

The training and testing codes for [Supervision-by-Registration (CVPR 2018)](https://xuanyidong.com/publication/cvpr-2018-sbr/) are located in the [SBR directory](https://github.com/D-X-Y/landmark-detection/tree/master/SBR).

## Teacher Supervises Students How to Learn from Partially Labeled Images for Facial Landmark Detection

The model codes for [Teacher Supervises Students (TS3) (ICCV 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02116) are located in the [TS3 directory](https://github.com/D-X-Y/landmark-detection/tree/master/TS3).
